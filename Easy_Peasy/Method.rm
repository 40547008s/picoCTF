One-Time pad cryptography

use the same key to encrypt is dangerous.

This example is the server puts the flag with the One-Time pad key.
and then ask you anthor string to encrypt with the same key.

the solution is to use a long string "aaaa..." (50000 - flag_len) to receive the encrypt string.
And XOR the plaintext (aaa...) and encryptext than the key will appear!!

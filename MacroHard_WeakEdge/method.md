Forensics SOP:

First check the file type

command : file <target_file>

Second binwalk it

command : binwalk <target_file>
#hint -e (extract the file in it)

there are useful command:

command : strings <target_file>
#To show the string in the file

there are also command encode using "Base64" or rotate Ascii

good luck~
